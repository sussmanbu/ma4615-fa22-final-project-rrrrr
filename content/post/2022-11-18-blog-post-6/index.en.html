<h2>Interactive Plan</h2>
<p>We plan to develop an interactive app through R Shiney that will allow people to explore various causes and their impacts on Massachusetts Highway-Rail accidents. The interactive has different graphs as well to better visualize the relationship between accident counts and factors like weather conditions, temperature, visibility, speed, and traffic volume by county separately.</p>
<p>Here are some of our ideas:</p>
<p>Filtering by <code>County Name</code>, users are able to focus only on the county in MA they are interested in. Filtering by various factors, users are able to see visually where some cause tends to have more accident numbers than others. For example, filtering by weather conditions, we may see drastic differences when it’s “Clear” vs. when it’s “Rain”. But, this result might be counterintuitive as we expect that there will be more accidents during the clear days, regardless of county, by our initial analysis of the data. Users can also explore other causes, like temperature, visibility, and vehicle speed, to see the potential relevant causes.</p>
<p>Also, we plan to add some “inputs” for users to interact with. As we merged a traffic volume dataset for further analysis to see if the traffic volume would be a confounding variable of accident count. Thus, we plan to graph the trends of both traffic volume from 2017 to 2022 and our accident count dataset, filtering by year. By selecting the range of years, we may see the trends of changes in both traffic volume and accident count by month. Therefore, users might have some inferences on the correlation between the two. Also, an interaction with a range of time series can be used to see if there’s any seasonal pattern when more accidents might happen during a year.</p>
<p>These insights could potentially have some enlightenment on what kind of safety measures could be pushed and under what kind of circumstances should they be the most intense or have the most major improvement on decreasing accident rate.</p>
