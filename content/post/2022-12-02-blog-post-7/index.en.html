<h2>Plans for the next two weeks</h2>
<p>There are two main concerns that we have about our current results on the analysis page.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, the graph shown in section 2.2 has not shown a clear relationship or any patterns. Our group plans to figure out the correlation by running a regression analysis between the variables next week.</li>
<li>Another concern is also about the graphs in section 2.2. The graph shown now looks very confusing and hard to read. We will further rearrange the variables and fit the variables into one clear and easy-to-read graph.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Polish visualizations and tables</h2>
<p>We found our graphsâ€™ x-axis in section 2.2.3 and 2.2 very hard to read because the labels are overlapping. To solve this problem, we will try to make the words vertical or separate the labels by maybe only showing the labels every three months. Before submitting the final version of our group project, we will check all labels of x-axes and y-axes to make sure they are readable and clear.</p>
