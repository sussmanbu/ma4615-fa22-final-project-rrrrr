<h2>Tentative Thesis</h2>
<ul>
<li>As temperatures rise, weather conditions improve , and roads conditions improve, the likelihood of accidents happened at railroad crossings in Massachusetts increases.</li>
</ul>
<p>We first hypothesized that the worse the weather conditions were, the more accidents it would have. However, by exploring the data, surprisingly, we found that it is actually the clear days have the highest count of accidents with the largest temperature range.</p>
<p>We suspected that the reasons might be related to the traffic flow. In other words, the better the weather, the higher the visibility and the better the road conditions, the more people tend to drive, which leads to an increased likelihood of accidents. However, after we plot the graphs, we don’t see any patterns between traffic volume and accident counts. To prove our findings, we plan to run regression to come up with a conclusion. We failed to prove that an increase in traffic leads to an increase in the likelihood of accidents. Therefore, we conclude that the traffic flow was not a critical factor in the accident</p>
<ul>
<li>Slowing down or staying at an intersection increases the likelihood of an accident
We want to explore the relationship between accident number and the speed of crushed cars and trains. So, the response variable we chose is the accident number of each county, and the predictor variables are Train Speed and Estimated Vehicle Speed. We fit the data by multiple linear regression model and we don’t need to make any transformations of the predictors.As the coefficients for independent variables are negative, slower speed of trains and vehicles might lead to higher number of accident counts. Noticeably, at the 90% confidence level we chose, p-values are less than 0.1, thus, the estimates are statistically significant.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Our Future Plan</h2>
<p>We will complete our Big Picture and interactive sections in the next few days. The Facet_grid needs to be divided into two rows. In Shiny, we need to change the county name and add slider. We also need to add the traffic volume.</p>
