<h2>When is the safest time to drive in Massachusetts?</h2>
<p>Our objective is to working on the United States Crossway Rail road accidents rate dataset and research on what factors that might lead to the increase of the accidents rate and figure what are the ways for the people to predict and save themselves from the accidents. And our primary target city to work on is Masshechusetts, which is the city we live in, we suspected that masschusetts as one of the oldest region that began to develop rainway roads and systems, so the railway road and system might be outdated which might lead to a higher accident rate. And these kind of accidents were seldom been researched and mentioned. To protect people from it, our group is dedicating to find the factors that might have the higher probability to cause this.<br />
 <br />
Thesis:</p>
<p>Working with the huge dataset that contains the every dated details of each accident, we are able to deal with the factors we want and summarize their total counts. Based on the timely gap, we have the skill to consider technology innovation, construction renovation and other reasons that why these events occurred. The other datasets that we can access to in the government’s database could bring us more extensive insight for our analysis and we are able to combine them with our original research to provide people with specific advice on safer traveling.</p>

<h2>Actionable insights/recommendations</h2>
<p><strong>Weather condition is the #1 Reason for Traffic Collisions</strong>
From our analysis, it is easy to see that accidents occur at a significantly higher rate on warm, clear days, especially during the day. We attribute this finding to the traffic volume in each weather condition during the day.<br />
 <br />

There is a significantly large proportion of accidents happening either during the day or during the dark. With navigation itself already being difficult at night, insufficient lighting also leads to distractions for drivers, which then increases their reaction times. In addition to visibility, roads at night will also have more tired and drunk drivers pose the risk of poor or unpredictable driving behavior, which further increases the frequency of accidents. However, since daytime has the largest proportion of accident counts in most weather conditions, we are also very interested in the reasons that lead to the outcomes.<br />

<p><br />
 <br />
With the traffic volume significantly higher during the day, it is plausible to assume more potential accident counts during the day with any weather conditions and roadway conditions. This may be because people feel the weather and road conditions are perfect, so they lowered their preparedness. In turn, negligent drivers pose the risk of poor or unpredictable driving behavior, which further increases the frequency of collisions.<br />

<p><br />
 <br />
Our recommendations to combat the difficulties of daytime driving are to enhance noticeable and important road signs to attract drivers’ attention and thus remind them of careful driving. This also helps drivers have an easier time seeing and reacting to any potential hazards.<br />
 <br />
<strong>Traffic volum was not the key factor in the accident</strong>
Further, we hope to have a more detailed study of the cause of the accident. We plan to add the factor of traffic flow to analyze the causes of accidents. With good visibility, clear weather and good road conditions, the number of accidents is higher instead. It’s very counter-intuitive. We believe this may be because people tend to travel in conditions suitable for driving, which leads to the increase of traffic flow in these circumstances, more likely to occur in more collision accidents.<br />

 <br />
We looked at average monthly vehicle traffic in the state of Massachusetts from 2017 to 2022. We plot the graphs based on time of day, monthly traffic, and weather conditions. However, based on our graph, we did not find a clear pattern to prove that our higher traffic would lead to more collisions. So we decided to build a linear model between average traffic volume and Clear Day proportion to help us have a more accurate understanding.<br />
 <br />

<p><br />
 <br />
Our model does support our view, that is, the increase in traffic volume does not directly lead to the increase in the number of accidents. This result in turn corroborates our previous research. Although traffic flow tends to increase in better weather, it is not directly related to the number of accidents. The relaxed attitude in good weather and high visibility may have been the main cause of the accident. In fact, more accidents are caused by negligence than by poor sight conditions. Good road conditions often lead to driver negligence.<br />
 <br />
<strong>Low Speed is the More Deadly accident Cause</strong>
Besides the potential distraction or carelessness of drivers, which are both hard to control since it is inevitable for humans, our analysis also shows that speeding at HIGHWAY-RAIL CROSSING can be a factor in how deadly the accidents are. At highway-rail crossings, low speeding or stopping can be vital threats to accidents and even death since trains are not like cars that can immediately cut the speed or stop.</p>
<p>Our recommendation to address this issue is to add more noticeable signs and warnings at the crossing. Since many railroads have been built for a really long time, we may also recommend government or related departments improve lighting or voice prompts at the crossing to notice both trains and cars.</p>
